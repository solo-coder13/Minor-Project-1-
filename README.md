# Quantum Ant Colony Optimization
Quantum Ant Colony Optimisation optimises structural topology, a conventional engineering issue. We use quantum computing's superposition and entanglement and ant-inspired creatures' intelligence to optimise structural design and engineering. Engineers and designers across sectors employ structural topology optimisation to construct creative and efficient structures. It optimises design area material allocation under strict limits to deliver resource-efficient, cost-effective, and high-performance solutions. To use cutting-edge technology, companies need imaginative engineering solutions and optimisation methodologies that study large solution areas. 

# Objective
The primary objective of this project is two-fold. First, it aims to investigate the theoretical foundations of Quantum Ant Colony Optimization and its applicability to engineering problems, particularly in the context of structural topology optimization. Second, it seeks to provide practical insights into implementing QACO, offering a roadmap for engineers and researchers eager to harness the power of quantum computing in their quest for optimised structural designs.

# Mathematical Formulation
The structural topology optimization problem can be mathematically formulated as
Minimise:     f(x)
Subject to:          Ω⊆Rn (Design domain)
                     x∈Rn   (Design variables)
                     gi(x)≤0,   i=1,2,…,m (Inequality constraints)
                     hj(x)=0,   j=1,2,…,p (Equality constraints)
​
Where:
f(x) is the objective function to be minimised or maximised.
Ω is the design domain.
x represents the design variables.
gi(x) are inequality constraints representing structural or geometric limits.
ℎj(x) are equality constraints representing boundary conditions or other requirements.
